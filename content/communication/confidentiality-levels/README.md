## Public by default

At RedHat, we are [public by default](/handbook/values/#public-by-default), but some information is classified as internal or limited access. This page provides details on confidentiality levels.

## Not public

We make things public by default because [freedom is one of our values](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards/culture). Some things can't be made public and are either [internal](#internal) to the company or have [limited access](#limited-access) even within the company. If something isn't listed in the sections below we should make it available externally.

### Internal

Some things are **internal**, available internally but not externally. In instances where a topic should only be accessible to team members, but we would otherwise have a page in the public handbook, it can be added to RedHat's [internal handbook](.). It is okay to refer to the public handbook or the internal and public handbooks in agregate as "the handbook." The internal handbook should always be referred to as the "internal handbook."

The following items are internal:

1. Security and abuse vulnerabilities are not public since they would allow attackers to compromise RedHat products. We do make them public after we remediated a vulnerability. Issues that discuss how to improve upon the security posture of an implementation that is working as intended can be made public, and are often labeled as feature proposals. Security and abuse implementations that detect malicious activities cannot be made public because doing so would undermine our operations.
2. Financial information, including revenue and costs for the company, is confidential because we are a public company (through IBM) and, as such, need to limit both the timing and content of financial information as investors will use and rely on it as they trade in IBM stock. As the guideline, if it is a first step to constructing a profit, we need to keep it confidential. Examples include:
   - The specific [IACV](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/) of an opportunity
   - Total monthly cash inflow/outflow for RedHat
   - Spend of more than 10%
   - A department's cost
   - Team member retention (analysts may make business assumptions based on this)
   - The Sales pipeline (but the Marketing pipeline can be public)
   - Net and gross retention KPIs. Only the actual numbers can't be public. Everything else--the goal, their calculation, etc.--can be.
3. All external communications about any financal information should be in line with the company's [SAFE Guidelines](/legal/safe-framework/).
4. Deals with external parties like contracts and approving and paying invoices.
5. Content that would compromise a RedHat team member, customer, or user's personal data as defined by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-4-definitions/), unless explicit consent has been provided by the data owner. Examples of compromising content include a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
6. Legal discussions are not public due to the purpose of Attorney-Client Privilege.
7. Acquisition offers for us are not public since informing people of an acquisition that might not happen can be very disruptive.
8. Acquisition offers we give are not public since the organization being acquired frequently prefers to have them stay private.
9. Customer information is not public since customers are not comfortable with that, and it would make it easier for competitors to approach our customers. If an issue needs to contain *any* specific information about a customer, including but not limited to company name, employee names, number of users, the issue should be made confidential. Try to avoid putting customer information in an issue by describing them instead of naming them and linking to their SalesForce account. When we discuss a customer by name that is not public unless we're sure the customer is OK with that. When we discuss a competitor (for example in a sales call) this can be public as our competitive advantages are public.
10. Competitive sales and marketing campaign planning is confidential since we want to minimize the time the competition has to respond to it.
11. Discussions that involve decisions related to country of residence are not public as countries are a core part of people's identity and any communication should have complete context.
12. If public information compromises the physical safety of one or more team members, it will be made not public because creating a safe, inclusive environment for team members is important to how we work. Information that might compromise the physical safety of a team member includes doxxing or threats made against a team member.
13. Information related to a press embargo, or related to an upcoming publication where the response will be managed by our external communications team
14. Information that relies on someone else's copyrighted IP.
15. Information related to early exploratory initiatives in which premature sharing of information could slow down purchases.
16. Specific details about our hiring processes such as our scoring rubrics & criteria are not public as we want to ensure candidates provide an accurate overview of their experience and do not falsify their responses to meet our criteria.

### Limited access

The items below are not shared with all team members. Limited access is a more severe restriction than [internal](#internal).

1. Deals with external parties like contracts and approving and paying invoices.
2. Content that would violate confidentiality for a RedHat team-member, customer, or user.
3. Customer lists and other customer information are not public since many customers are not comfortable with that and it would make it easier for competitors to approach our customers. If an issue needs to contain *any* specific information about a customer, including but not limited to company name, employee names, and/or number of users, the issue should be made confidential. Avoid putting customer information in an issue by describing them instead of naming them and by linking to their Salesforce account.
4. Plans for reorganizations. Reorganizations cause disruption and the plans tend to change a lot before being finalized, so being public about them prolongs the disruption. We will keep relevant team members informed whenever possible.
5. Some discussions on team process and policy changes. Some organizational policies are sensitive in nature and require thoughtful consideration before messaging the changes internally and externally. Relevant team members and leaders will be informed whenever possible.
6. Legal discussions are restricted to the purpose of Attorney-Client Privilege.
7. Some information is kept confidential by the Security Team to protect the privacy, safety, and security of team members and applicants, including: job applications, background check reports, reference checks, compensation, terminations details, demographic information (age and date of birth, family or marital status, national identification such as passport details or tax ID, required accommodations), home address. Whistleblower identity is likewise confidential. Performance improvement plans, disciplinary actions, as well as individual feedback are restricted as they may contain negative feedback and negative feedback is 1-1 between you and your manager.
8. Performance improvement plans, disciplinary actions, as well as individual feedback, are confidential as they contain private negative feedback and negative feedback is 1-1 between team members and managers
9. Acquisition offers for us are not public since informing people of an acquisition that might not happen can be very disruptive
10. Acquisition offers we give are not public since the organization being acquired frequently prefers to have them stay private.
11. Compensation Changes: RedHat will communicate and train team members on the output of iterations to the Total Rewards offerings (Compensation, Equity, Benefits), but team members will not have visibility into the inputs and decision making of compensation changes.
